# Discovering Interpretable Directions in the Semantic Latent Space of Diffusion Models

Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11073.pdf

This is an inofficial implementation. Not all the details are correct, especially for section 2. The implementation is quite simple. All code can be found in [h-space-directions.ipynb](h-space-directions.ipynb).

## Example Results

### 1. Global semantic directions - PCA



### 2. Discovering image-specific semantic edits



### 3. Supervised discovery of semantic directions
